P.O.O.P.S. or Parser Of On-campus Preferred Specials

A python script that takes menu items from RIT restaurants
(not including petals and henry's) so that you may find out
what is available to eat today.  

P.O.O.P.S. offers the user a simple command line UI, giving
you the choice to pick any restaurant available or to quit.
I am looking into adding more functionality, but for now,
that is all that is available.

Currently, the food listed is printed to the screen in
lexicographical order.  I am working on formatting like the
following:

Bar or Grill name
   - Food items available

The way that RIT's dining services puts the menus on thier
websites is not consistant so making all restaurants
formatted similar to the example above could be rather
challenging, for me at least.
